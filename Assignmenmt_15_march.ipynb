Clustering algorithms can group similar data points together based on their similarity, and data points that are significantly different from the other points in a cluster can be identified as anomalies. For example, if most data points in a cluster have similar values for certain features, a data point with a value that deviates significantly from the mean or median of the feature can be flagged as an anomaly.<br>\n",

Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE can be used to identify patterns in high-dimensional data by reducing the number of features or variables. Anomalies can then be identified by looking for data points that do not fit into the reduced pattern.\n"
