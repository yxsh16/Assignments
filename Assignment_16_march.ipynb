    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and has learned the training data too well, to the point where it starts to fit noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. As a result, the model may perform very well on the training data, but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

    "Overfitting can lead to poor generalization performance, making the model useless for real-world applications. Underfitting, on the other hand, means that the model is unable to capture the patterns in the data, and may miss important relationships between the features and target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, we can use techniques such as regularization, which adds a penalty term to the objective function to prevent the model from over-relying on certain features. Another approach is to use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and select the model with the best performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate underfitting, we can try increasing the model's complexity by adding more features or increasing the model's capacity. However, we should be careful not to overdo this, as it may lead to overfitting. We can also try using a more sophisticated model that is better suited for the data at hand, or use ensemble techniques to combine multiple models to improve performance."
