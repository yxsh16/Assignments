    "Missing values in a dataset refer to the absence of data in one or more fields of a record. Missing values can occur due to various reasons such as data entry errors, data corruption, or data not being collected for some samples.Handling missing values is essential because they can have a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of any data analysis or modeling that is performed using the dataset. If missing values are not dealt with properly, it can lead to biased results, reduced statistical power, and incorrect conclusions.<br>\n",

For example, if the majority class has 95% of the samples, and the minority class has only 5%, down-sampling can be used to reduce the number of samples in the majority class to balance the class distribution. However, as mentioned earlier, down-sampling may discard some information, which can affect the model's performance."

    "Outliers in a dataset refer to observations that are significantly different from other observations in the dataset.
